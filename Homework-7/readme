Instructions on how to run code :

1) run tp.py on hyp1-hyp2-ref and dev.answers
2) It will create following files : train-ref35k , test-ref15k , train-answers35k , test-answers15k
3) Code will be run on training files to avoid overfitting.
4) run following command to generate output file : python2.7 evaluate-training > eval.out
5) Code will take time to run as its using SVM classifier.
