1	From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s
2	With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s
3	His tender heir might bear his memory:	s
4	But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s
5	Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s
6	Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s
7	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s
8	And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s
9	Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s
10	And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s
11	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	s
12	To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	s
13	When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	s
14	Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	s
15	Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	s
16	Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	s
17	Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	s
18	Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	s
19	To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	s
20	Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	s
21	If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	s
22	Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	s
23	Proving his beauty by succession thine!	s
24	This were to be new made when thou art old,	s
25	Now is the time that face should form another;	s
26	Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	s
27	Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	s
28	For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	s
29	Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	s
30	Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	s
31	Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	s
32	Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	s
33	So thou through windows of thine age shall see	s
34	Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	s
35	But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	s
36	Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	s
37	Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	s
38	Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:	s
39	Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	s
40	And being frank she lends to those are free.	s
41	The bounteous largess given thee to give?	s
42	Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	s
43	So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	s
44	For having traffic with thyself alone,	s
45	Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	s
46	Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	s
47	What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	s
48	Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	s
49	Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	s
50	Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	s
51	The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	s
52	Will play the tyrants to the very same	s
53	And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	s
54	For never-resting time leads summer on	s
55	To hideous winter and confounds him there;	s
56	Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	s
57	Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	s
58	Then, were not summer's distillation left,	s
59	Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	s
60	But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	s
61	Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	s
62	Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	s
63	In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	s
64	Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	s
65	With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	s
66	That use is not forbidden usury,	s
67	Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	s
68	Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	s
69	Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	s
70	If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	s
71	Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	s
72	Leaving thee living in posterity?	s
73	Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	s
74	Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	s
75	Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	s
76	Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	s
77	Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	s
78	And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	s
79	Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	s
80	Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	s
81	Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	s
82	But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	s
83	Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	s
84	The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	s
85	From his low tract and look another way:	s
86	So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	s
87	Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	s
88	Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	s
89	Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	s
90	Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	s
91	That is so proud thy service to despise,	s
92	Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	s
93	By unions married, do offend thine ear,	s
94	They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	s
95	In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	s
96	Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	s
97	Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	s
98	Resembling sire and child and happy mother	s
99	Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	s
100	Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	s
101	Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	s
102	Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	s
103	That thou consumest thyself in single life?	s
104	Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	s
105	The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	s
106	The world will be thy widow and still weep	s
107	That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	s
108	When every private widow well may keep	s
109	By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	s
110	Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	s
111	Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	s
112	But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	s
113	And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	s
114	No love toward others in that bosom sits	s
115	That on himself such murderous shame commits.	s
116	For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	s
117	And so the general of hot desire	s
118	Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	s
119	But that thou none lovest is most evident;	s
120	For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	s
121	That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	s
122	Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	s
123	Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	s
124	'I hate' from hate away she threw,	s
125	Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	s
126	Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	s
127	Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	s
128	That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	s
129	As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	s
130	In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	s
131	Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	s
132	Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	s
133	If all were minded so, the times should cease	s
134	And threescore year would make the world away.	s
135	Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	s
136	Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	s
137	She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	s
138	Those lips that Love's own hand did make	s
139	When I do count the clock that tells the time,	s
140	And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	s
141	When I behold the violet past prime,	s
142	When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	s
143	Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	s
144	And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	s
145	Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	s
146	Then of thy beauty do I question make,	s
147	That thou among the wastes of time must go,	s
148	Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	s
149	And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	s
150	Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	s
151	O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	s
152	No longer yours than you yourself here live:	s
153	Against this coming end you should prepare,	s
154	And your sweet semblance to some other give.	s
155	Find no determination: then you were	s
156	Yourself again after yourself's decease,	s
157	Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	s
158	Which husbandry in honour might uphold	s
159	Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	s
160	And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	s
161	O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	s
162	You had a father: let your son say so.	s
163	Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	s
164	And yet methinks I have astronomy,	s
165	But not to tell of good or evil luck,	s
166	Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	s
167	Making a famine where abundance lies,	s
168	Or say with princes if it shall go well,	s
169	By oft predict that I in heaven find:	s
170	But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	s
171	And, constant stars, in them I read such art	s
172	If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	s
173	Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	s
174	Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	s
175	The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;	s
176	That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	s
177	Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	s
178	Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,	s
179	Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	s
180	And wear their brave state out of memory;	s
181	Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	s
182	Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	s
183	Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	s
184	To change your day of youth to sullied night;	s
185	And all in war with Time for love of you,	s
186	But wherefore do not you a mightier way	s
187	Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	s
188	And fortify yourself in your decay	s
189	With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	s
190	Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	s
191	Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	s
192	So should the lines of life that life repair,	s
193	Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	s
194	No marvel then, though I mistake my view;	s
195	Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	s
196	To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	s
197	And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	s
198	Who will believe my verse in time to come,	s
199	Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	s
200	Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	s
201	If I could write the beauty of your eyes	s
202	And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	s
203	The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	s
204	Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	s
205	So should my papers yellow'd with their age	s
206	Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	s
207	And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	s
208	But were some child of yours alive that time,	s
209	Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	s
210	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	s
211	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	s
212	And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	s
213	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	s
214	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	s
215	And every fair from fair sometime declines,	s
216	By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	s
217	But thy eternal summer shall not fade	s
218	And let that pine to aggravate thy store;	s
219	Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	s
220	When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	s
221	So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	s
222	So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	s
223	Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	s
224	And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	s
225	Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	s
226	And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	s
227	Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	s
228	And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	s
229	To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	s
230	But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	s
231	O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	s
232	Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	s
233	Him in thy course untainted do allow	s
234	For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	s
235	Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	s
236	My love shall in my verse ever live young.	s
237	A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	s
238	Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	s
239	A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	s
240	With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	s
241	An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	s
242	Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	s
243	A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	s
244	Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	s
245	And for a woman wert thou first created;	s
246	Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	s
247	And by addition me of thee defeated,	s
248	By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	s
249	But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	s
250	Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	s
251	So is it not with me as with that Muse	s
252	Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	s
253	Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	s
254	And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	s
255	Making a couplement of proud compare,	s
256	With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	s
257	With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	s
258	O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	s
259	And then believe me, my love is as fair	s
260	To make me give the lie to my true sight,	s
261	As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	s
262	Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	s
263	I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	s
264	My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	s
265	So long as youth and thou are of one date;	s
266	But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	s
267	Then look I death my days should expiate.	s
268	For all that beauty that doth cover thee	s
269	Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	s
270	Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	s
271	How can I then be elder than thou art?	s
272	O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	s
273	As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	s
274	Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	s
275	As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	s
276	Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	s
277	Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	s
278	As an unperfect actor on the stage	s
279	And taught it thus anew to greet:	s
280	Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	s
281	Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	s
282	So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	s
283	The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	s
284	And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	s
285	O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	s
286	O, let my books be then the eloquence	s
287	And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	s
288	More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	s
289	O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	s
290	When I break twenty? I am perjured most;	s
291	Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	s
292	Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	s
293	My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	s
294	And perspective it is the painter's art.	s
295	For through the painter must you see his skill,	s
296	To find where your true image pictured lies;	s
297	Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	s
298	But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;	s
299	Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	s
300	Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	s
301	Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	s
302	Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	s
303	They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	s
304	Let those who are in favour with their stars	s
305	Of public honour and proud titles boast,	s
306	Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	s
307	Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	s
308	Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	s
309	But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	s
310	And in themselves their pride lies buried,	s
311	The painful warrior famoused for fight,	s
312	Is from the book of honour razed quite,	s
313	And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	s
314	Then happy I, that love and am beloved	s
315	Where I may not remove nor be removed.	s
316	Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	s
317	Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	s
318	To witness duty, not to show my wit:	s
319	Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	s
320	May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	s
321	But that I hope some good conceit of thine	s
322	In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	s
323	Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	s
324	Points on me graciously with fair aspect	s
325	And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	s
326	To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	s
327	Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	s
328	Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	s
329	Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	s
330	The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	s
331	But then begins a journey in my head,	s
332	To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	s
333	For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	s
334	And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	s
335	Looking on darkness which the blind do see	s
336	Save that my soul's imaginary sight	s
337	Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	s
338	Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	s
339	Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	s
340	Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	s
341	For thee and for myself no quiet find.	s
342	And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,	s
343	That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	s
344	But found no cure: the bath for my help lies	s
345	But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	s
346	Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	s
347	The one by toil, the other to complain	s
348	How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	s
349	I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	s
350	Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	s
351	So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	s
352	When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	s
353	Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	s
354	And night doth nightly make grief's strength	s
355	When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	s
356	I all alone beweep my outcast state	s
357	And look upon myself and curse my fate,	s
358	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	s
359	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	s
360	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	s
361	With what I most enjoy contented least;	s
362	Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	s
363	Like to the lark at break of day arising	s
364	That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	s
365	When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	s
366	I summon up remembrance of things past,	s
367	I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	s
368	And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	s
369	For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	s
370	And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	s
371	And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	s
372	Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	s
373	And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	s
374	The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	s
375	O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,	s
376	All losses are restored and sorrows end.	s
377	Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	s
378	And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,	s
379	And all those friends which I thought buried.	s
380	How many a holy and obsequious tear	s
381	Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	s
382	As interest of the dead, which now appear	s
383	But things removed that hidden in thee lie!	s
384	Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,	s
385	Who all their parts of me to thee did give;	s
386	Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,	s
387	Their images I loved I view in thee,	s
388	And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.	s
389	If thou survive my well-contented day,	s
390	When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,	s
391	And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	s
392	These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,	s
393	Compare them with the bettering of the time,	s
394	And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,	s
395	Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,	s
396	Exceeded by the height of happier men.	s
397	O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:	s
398	'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,	s
399	A dearer birth than this his love had brought,	s
400	To march in ranks of better equipage:	s
401	How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	s
402	Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'	s
403	Full many a glorious morning have I seen	s
404	Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,	s
405	Kissing with golden face the meadows green,	s
406	Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;	s
407	Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	s
408	And from the forlorn world his visage hide,	s
409	Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:	s
410	Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,	s
411	But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;	s
412	The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.	s
413	Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;	s
414	Revenge upon myself with present moan?	s
415	Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	s
416	And make me travel forth without my cloak,	s
417	To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,	s
418	Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?	s
419	'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,	s
420	To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,	s
421	For no man well of such a salve can speak	s
422	The fairest votary took up that fire	s
423	Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:	s
424	The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	s
425	To him that bears the strong offence's cross.	s
426	Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	s
427	And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.	s
428	Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;	s
429	All men make faults, and even I in this,	s
430	Authorizing thy trespass with compare,	s
431	Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;	s
432	Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.	s
433	Thy adverse party is thy advocate--	s
434	And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:	s
435	Such civil war is in my love and hate	s
436	That I an accessary needs must be	s
437	Desire is death, which physic did except.	s
438	For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	s
439	So shall those blots that do with me remain	s
440	Without thy help by me be borne alone.	s
441	In our two loves there is but one respect,	s
442	Though in our lives a separable spite,	s
443	Which though it alter not love's sole effect,	s
444	Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.	s
445	Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,	s
446	Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	s
447	Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	s
448	And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	s
449	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
450	As a decrepit father takes delight	s
451	So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,	s
452	Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.	s
453	Or any of these all, or all, or more,	s
454	Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,	s
455	I make my love engrafted to this store:	s
456	So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	s
457	Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	s
458	That I in thy abundance am sufficed	s
459	And by a part of all thy glory live.	s
460	When I against myself with thee partake?	s
461	This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	s
462	How can my Muse want subject to invent,	s
463	While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse	s
464	Thine own sweet argument, too excellent	s
465	For every vulgar paper to rehearse?	s
466	O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me	s
467	Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;	s
468	For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,	s
469	When thou thyself dost give invention light?	s
470	Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	s
471	Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;	s
472	And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	s
473	Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	s
474	If my slight Muse do please these curious days,	s
475	O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,	s
476	When thou art all the better part of me?	s
477	What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?	s
478	And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?	s
479	Even for this let us divided live,	s
480	And our dear love lose name of single one,	s
481	That by this separation I may give	s
482	That due to thee which thou deservest alone.	s
483	O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,	s
484	Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	s
485	O, though I love what others do abhor,	s
486	And that thou teachest how to make one twain,	s
487	By praising him here who doth hence remain!	s
488	When all my best doth worship thy defect,	s
489	What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	s
490	To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	s
491	Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,	s
492	Then if for my love thou my love receivest,	s
493	I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;	s
494	But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest	s
495	By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.	s
496	I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,	s
497	Although thou steal thee all my poverty;	s
498	And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief	s
499	To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.	s
500	Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	s
501	Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,	s
502	When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	s
503	Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,	s
504	For still temptation follows where thou art.	s
505	Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,	s
506	Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;	s
507	And when a woman woos, what woman's son	s
508	Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?	s
509	Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,	s
510	And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,	s
511	Who lead thee in their riot even there	s
512	Or made them swear against the thing they see;	s
513	Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	s
514	That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,	s
515	And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;	s
516	A loss in love that touches me more nearly.	s
517	Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:	s
518	Within be fed, without be rich no more:	s
519	And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	s
520	Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.	s
521	If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	s
522	And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;	s
523	Both find each other, and I lose both twain,	s
524	And both for my sake lay on me this cross:	s
525	But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;	s
526	Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	s
527	When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,	s
528	But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	s
529	And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.	s
530	I guess one angel in another's hell:	s
531	To the clear day with thy much clearer light,	s
532	By looking on thee in the living day,	s
533	When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	s
534	Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	s
535	All days are nights to see till I see thee,	s
536	And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	s
537	If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,	s
538	Injurious distance should not stop my way;	s
539	For then despite of space I would be brought,	s
540	Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,	s
541	Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;	s
542	For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	s
543	As soon as think the place where he would be.	s
544	To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	s
545	But that so much of earth and water wrought	s
546	A maid of Dian's this advantage found,	s
547	Receiving nought by elements so slow	s
548	But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	s
549	The other two, slight air and purging fire,	s
550	Are both with thee, wherever I abide;	s
551	The first my thought, the other my desire,	s
552	These present-absent with swift motion slide.	s
553	Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?	s
554	In tender embassy of love to thee,	s
555	My life, being made of four, with two alone	s
556	Until life's composition be recured	s
557	By those swift messengers return'd from thee,	s
558	Who even but now come back again, assured	s
559	Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:	s
560	This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,	s
561	I send them back again and straight grow sad.	s
562	Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	s
563	How to divide the conquest of thy sight;	s
564	Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,	s
565	My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.	s
566	My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--	s
567	A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--	s
568	But the defendant doth that plea deny	s
569	And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	s
570	To 'cide this title is impanneled	s
571	The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:	s
572	As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,	s
573	And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.	s
574	Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	s
575	And each doth good turns now unto the other:	s
576	When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,	s
577	Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,	s
578	With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	s
579	And to the painted banquet bids my heart;	s
580	Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	s
581	And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:	s
582	So, either by thy picture or my love,	s
583	For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,	s
584	And I am still with them and they with thee;	s
585	Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight	s
586	Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,	s
587	How careful was I, when I took my way,	s
588	Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,	s
589	That to my use it might unused stay	s
590	From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!	s
591	But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,	s
592	Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,	s
593	Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,	s
594	Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?	s
595	Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,	s
596	Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	s
597	In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;	s
598	From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;	s
599	And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,	s
600	For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.	s
601	Against that time, if ever that time come,	s
602	When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	s
603	When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	s
604	Call'd to that audit by advised respects;	s
605	A dateless lively heat, still to endure,	s
606	Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.	s
607	Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,	s
608	Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--	s
609	Against that time do I ensconce me here	s
610	Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	s
611	And this my hand against myself uprear,	s
612	To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:	s
613	To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,	s
614	Since why to love I can allege no cause.	s
615	How heavy do I journey on the way,	s
616	When what I seek, my weary travel's end,	s
617	Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	s
618	Why so large cost, having so short a lease,	s
619	The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,	s
620	Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	s
621	As if by some instinct the wretch did know	s
622	His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:	s
623	The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	s
624	That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;	s
625	Which heavily he answers with a groan,	s
626	More sharp to me than spurring to his side;	s
627	For that same groan doth put this in my mind;	s
628	My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	s
629	Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	s
630	Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:	s
631	From where thou art why should I haste me thence?	s
632	Till I return, of posting is no need.	s
633	O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,	s
634	When swift extremity can seem but slow?	s
635	Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;	s
636	In winged speed no motion shall I know:	s
637	Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;	s
638	But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;	s
639	Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,	s
640	Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,	s
641	The which he will not every hour survey,	s
642	For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.	s
643	Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	s
644	Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,	s
645	Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,	s
646	Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	s
647	So is the time that keeps you as my chest,	s
648	Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,	s
649	To make some special instant special blest,	s
650	By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.	s
651	Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,	s
652	What is your substance, whereof are you made,	s
653	That millions of strange shadows on you tend?	s
654	Since every one hath, every one, one shade,	s
655	Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	s
656	Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit	s
657	Is poorly imitated after you;	s
658	On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,	s
659	And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	s
660	Speak of the spring and foison of the year;	s
661	The one doth shadow of your beauty show,	s
662	The other as your bounty doth appear;	s
663	And you in every blessed shape we know.	s
664	In all external grace you have some part,	s
665	But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	s
666	O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	s
667	By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	s
668	The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	s
669	For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	s
670	The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye	s
671	If it be not, then love doth well denote	s
672	Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	s
673	When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:	s
674	But, for their virtue only is their show,	s
675	My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,	s
676	Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;	s
677	Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:	s
678	And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	s
679	When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.	s
680	Not marble, nor the gilded monuments	s
681	Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;	s
682	Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.	s
683	When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	s
684	And broils root out the work of masonry,	s
685	Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	s
686	The living record of your memory.	s
687	'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	s
688	Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room	s
689	Even in the eyes of all posterity	s
690	Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	s
691	So, till the judgment that yourself arise,	s
692	You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.	s
693	Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said	s
694	Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,	s
695	Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,	s
696	To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:	s
697	Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,	s
698	To-morrow see again, and do not kill	s
699	The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.	s
700	Let this sad interim like the ocean be	s
701	Which parts the shore, where two contracted new	s
702	Come daily to the banks, that, when they see	s
703	Return of love, more blest may be the view;	s
704	Else call it winter, which being full of care	s
705	Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.	s
706	Being your slave, what should I do but tend	s
707	I have no precious time at all to spend,	s
708	Nor services to do, till you require.	s
709	Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	s
710	Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,	s
711	Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	s
712	When you have bid your servant once adieu;	s
713	Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	s
714	Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,	s
715	And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	s
716	So true a fool is love that in your will,	s
717	Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.	s
718	That god forbid that made me first your slave,	s
719	I should in thought control your times of pleasure,	s
720	Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	s
721	To me that languish'd for her sake;	s
722	O, let me suffer, being at your beck,	s
723	The imprison'd absence of your liberty;	s
724	And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,	s
725	Without accusing you of injury.	s
726	Be where you list, your charter is so strong	s
727	That you yourself may privilege your time	s
728	To what you will; to you it doth belong	s
729	Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.	s
730	I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;	s
731	For, thou betraying me, I do betray	s
732	If there be nothing new, but that which is	s
733	Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	s
734	Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss	s
735	The second burden of a former child!	s
736	O, that record could with a backward look,	s
737	Even of five hundred courses of the sun,	s
738	Show me your image in some antique book,	s
739	To this composed wonder of your frame;	s
740	Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,	s
741	To subjects worse have given admiring praise.	s
742	Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,	s
743	So do our minutes hasten to their end;	s
744	Each changing place with that which goes before,	s
745	In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	s
746	Nativity, once in the main of light,	s
747	Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,	s
748	And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.	s
749	Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	s
750	And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	s
751	Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,	s
752	And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:	s
753	And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,	s
754	Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	s
755	Is it thy will thy image should keep open	s
756	My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	s
757	Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	s
758	While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	s
759	Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	s
760	So far from home into my deeds to pry,	s
761	To find out shames and idle hours in me,	s
762	O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:	s
763	It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;	s
764	Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,	s
765	To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.	s
766	To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	s
767	From me far off, with others all too near.	s
768	Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	s
769	And all my soul and all my every part;	s
770	And for this sin there is no remedy,	s
771	It is so grounded inward in my heart.	s
772	Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	s
773	No shape so true, no truth of such account;	s
774	And for myself mine own worth do define,	s
775	As I all other in all worths surmount.	s
776	But when my glass shows me myself indeed,	s
777	Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,	s
778	Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;	s
779	Self so self-loving were iniquity.	s
780	Do I not think on thee, when I forgot	s
781	Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	s
782	For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,	s
783	When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	s
784	With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn	s
785	Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,	s
786	And all those beauties whereof now he's king	s
787	Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,	s
788	Stealing away the treasure of his spring;	s
789	For such a time do I now fortify	s
790	But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,	s
791	That he shall never cut from memory	s
792	This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	s
793	Two loves I have of comfort and despair,	s
794	And they shall live, and he in them still green.	s
795	When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	s
796	The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	s
797	But since he died and poets better prove,	s
798	And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	s
799	When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	s
800	Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	s
801	Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?	s
802	Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	s
803	When I have seen such interchange of state,	s
804	No matter then although my foot did stand	s
805	Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,	s
806	That Time will come and take my love away.	s
807	Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.	s
808	But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	s
809	Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	s
810	There is such strength and warrantize of skill	s
811	How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,	s
812	Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	s
813	O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out	s
814	When rocks impregnable are not so stout,	s
815	Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?	s
816	Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,	s
817	With insufficiency my heart to sway?	s
818	Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?	s
819	On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?	s
820	Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,	s
821	That in black ink my love may still shine bright.	s
822	As, to behold desert a beggar born,	s
823	And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,	s
824	And purest faith unhappily forsworn,	s
825	And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,	s
826	And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,	s
827	And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,	s
828	And strength by limping sway disabled,	s
829	And art made tongue-tied by authority,	s
830	And folly doctor-like controlling skill,	s
831	And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,	s
832	And captive good attending captain ill:	s
833	Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	s
834	Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.	s
835	Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,	s
836	And with his presence grace impiety,	s
837	That sin by him advantage should achieve	s
838	And lace itself with his society?	s
839	Why should false painting imitate his cheek	s
840	And steal dead seeing of his living hue?	s
841	Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	s
842	Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?	s
843	Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,	s
844	Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?	s
845	And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.	s
846	O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had	s
847	In days long since, before these last so bad.	s
848	Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.	s
849	Before the bastard signs of fair were born,	s
850	Or durst inhabit on a living brow;	s
851	Before the golden tresses of the dead,	s
852	The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	s
853	To live a second life on second head;	s
854	Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:	s
855	In him those holy antique hours are seen,	s
856	Without all ornament, itself and true,	s
857	Making no summer of another's green,	s
858	Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;	s
859	And him as for a map doth Nature store,	s
860	To show false Art what beauty was of yore.	s
861	Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	s
862	Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;	s
863	All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,	s
864	Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	s
865	Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;	s
866	But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	s
867	In other accents do this praise confound	s
868	By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.	s
869	They look into the beauty of thy mind,	s
870	Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,	s
871	Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	s
872	But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	s
873	The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.	s
874	That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	s
875	And all my honest faith in thee is lost,	s
876	The ornament of beauty is suspect,	s
877	A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	s
878	So thou be good, slander doth but approve	s
879	Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;	s
880	For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	s
881	And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.	s
882	Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,	s
883	My love is as a fever, longing still	s
884	Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,	s
885	If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,	s
886	Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	s
887	No longer mourn for me when I am dead	s
888	Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell	s
889	Give warning to the world that I am fled	s
890	From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:	s
891	Nay, if you read this line, remember not	s
892	The hand that writ it; for I love you so	s
893	That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	s
894	If thinking on me then should make you woe.	s
895	O, if, I say, you look upon this verse	s
896	When I perhaps compounded am with clay,	s
897	Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.	s
898	But let your love even with my life decay,	s
899	Lest the wise world should look into your moan	s
900	I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,	s
901	O, lest the world should task you to recite	s
902	What merit lived in me, that you should love	s
903	After my death, dear love, forget me quite,	s
904	For you in me can nothing worthy prove;	s
905	Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	s
906	You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	s
907	And hang more praise upon deceased I	s
908	Than niggard truth would willingly impart:	s
909	O, lest your true love may seem false in this,	s
910	That you for love speak well of me untrue,	s
911	My name be buried where my body is,	s
912	And live no more to shame nor me nor you.	s
913	For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,	s
914	And so should you, to love things nothing worth.	s
915	That time of year thou mayst in me behold	s
916	When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	s
917	Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	s
918	Doth follow night, who like a fiend	s
919	As after sunset fadeth in the west,	s
920	Which by and by black night doth take away,	s
921	Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	s
922	In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	s
923	That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	s
924	As the death-bed whereon it must expire	s
925	Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.	s
926	Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	s
927	To love that well which thou must leave ere long.	s
928	But be contented: when that fell arrest	s
929	Without all bail shall carry me away,	s
930	My life hath in this line some interest,	s
931	Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.	s
932	When thou reviewest this, thou dost review	s
933	The very part was consecrate to thee:	s
934	The earth can have but earth, which is his due;	s
935	My spirit is thine, the better part of me:	s
936	So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,	s
937	The prey of worms, my body being dead,	s
938	The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	s
939	The worth of that is that which it contains,	s
940	And that is this, and this with thee remains.	s
941	Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;	s
942	And for the peace of you I hold such strife	s
943	As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;	s
944	Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	s
945	Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	s
946	Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;	s
947	Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	s
948	And by and by clean starved for a look;	s
949	Possessing or pursuing no delight,	s
950	Save what is had or must from you be took.	s
951	Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,	s
952	Or gluttoning on all, or all away.	s
953	Why is my verse so barren of new pride,	s
954	So far from variation or quick change?	s
955	Why with the time do I not glance aside	s
956	Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	s
957	Why write I still all one, ever the same,	s
958	And keep invention in a noted weed,	s
959	Showing their birth and where they did proceed?	s
960	O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,	s
961	And you and love are still my argument;	s
962	So all my best is dressing old words new,	s
963	Spending again what is already spent:	s
964	For as the sun is daily new and old,	s
965	So is my love still telling what is told.	s
966	Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	s
967	Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;	s
968	In vowing new hate after new love bearing.	s
969	And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.	s
970	The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	s
971	Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;	s
972	Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	s
973	Time's thievish progress to eternity.	s
974	Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,	s
975	Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find	s
976	These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,	s
977	As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,	s
978	So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	s
979	And found such fair assistance in my verse	s
980	And under thee their poesy disperse.	s
981	Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	s
982	And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	s
983	Have added feathers to the learned's wing	s
984	And given grace a double majesty.	s
985	And by their verdict is determined	s
986	Whose influence is thine and born of thee:	s
987	In others' works thou dost but mend the style,	s
988	And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;	s
989	But thou art all my art and dost advance	s
990	As high as learning my rude ignorance.	s
991	Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	s
992	My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	s
993	But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	s
994	He is contented thy poor drudge to be,	s
995	I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument	s
996	And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	s
997	Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	s
998	He robs thee of and pays it thee again.	s
999	He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	s
1000	From thy behavior; beauty doth he give	s
1001	And found it in thy cheek; he can afford	s
1002	No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.	s
1003	Then thank him not for that which he doth say,	s
1004	Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,	s
1005	And in the praise thereof spends all his might,	s
1006	To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!	s
1007	But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,	s
1008	Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.	s
1009	That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	s
1010	On your broad main doth wilfully appear.	s
1011	Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	s
1012	Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;	s
1013	Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,	s
1014	He of tall building and of goodly pride:	s
1015	Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	s
1016	The worst was this; my love was my decay.	s
1017	Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	s
1018	Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;	s
1019	Although in me each part will be forgotten.	s
1020	Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:	s
1021	The earth can yield me but a common grave,	s
1022	When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.	s
1023	Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	s
1024	Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,	s
1025	And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	s
1026	When all the breathers of this world are dead;	s
1027	You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--	s
1028	Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;	s
1029	And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	s
1030	The dedicated words which writers use	s
1031	Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	s
1032	Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	s
1033	And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.	s
1034	And therefore art enforced to seek anew	s
1035	Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	s
1036	And do so, love; yet when they have devised	s
1037	What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	s
1038	Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized	s
1039	In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;	s
1040	And their gross painting might be better used	s
1041	Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.	s
1042	And therefore to your fair no painting set;	s
1043	I found, or thought I found, you did exceed	s
1044	The barren tender of a poet's debt;	s
1045	And therefore have I slept in your report,	s
1046	That you yourself being extant well might show	s
1047	Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:	s
1048	Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	s
1049	This silence for my sin you did impute,	s
1050	Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;	s
1051	For I impair not beauty being mute,	s
1052	When others would give life and bring a tomb.	s
1053	There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	s
1054	Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	s
1055	Who is it that says most? which can say more	s
1056	Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?	s
1057	In whose confine immured is the store	s
1058	Which should example where your equal grew.	s
1059	Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	s
1060	That to his subject lends not some small glory;	s
1061	But he that writes of you, if he can tell	s
1062	That you are you, so dignifies his story,	s
1063	Not making worse what nature made so clear,	s
1064	And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	s
1065	Making his style admired every where.	s
1066	You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,	s
1067	Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	s
1068	While comments of your praise, richly compiled,	s
1069	I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,	s
1070	To every hymn that able spirit affords	s
1071	In polish'd form of well-refined pen.	s
1072	And to the most of praise add something more;	s
1073	But that is in my thought, whose love to you,	s
1074	Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.	s
1075	Then others for the breath of words respect,	s
1076	Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	s
1077	Bound for the prize of all too precious you,	s
1078	That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,	s
1079	Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	s
1080	No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	s
1081	Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	s
1082	That censures falsely what they see aright?	s
1083	Which have no correspondence with true sight!	s
1084	I was not sick of any fear from thence:	s
1085	But when your countenance fill'd up his line,	s
1086	Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.	s
1087	Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,	s
1088	And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:	s
1089	The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;	s
1090	My bonds in thee are all determinate.	s
1091	My soul doth tell my body that he may	s
1092	But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought	s
1093	The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	s
1094	And so my patent back again is swerving.	s
1095	Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,	s
1096	So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,	s
1097	Comes home again, on better judgment making.	s
1098	Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,	s
1099	In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	s
1100	When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	s
1101	And place my merit in the eye of scorn,	s
1102	Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,	s
1103	And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.	s
1104	With mine own weakness being best acquainted,	s
1105	Upon thy part I can set down a story	s
1106	Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,	s
1107	That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:	s
1108	And I by this will be a gainer too;	s
1109	Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;	s
1110	The injuries that to myself I do,	s
1111	Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.	s
1112	Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	s
1113	That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.	s
1114	Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	s
1115	And I will comment upon that offence;	s
1116	That follow'd it as gentle day	s
1117	Against thy reasons making no defence.	s
1118	My reason, the physician to my love,	s
1119	To set a form upon desired change,	s
1120	As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,	s
1121	I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,	s
1122	Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue	s
1123	Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	s
1124	Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong	s
1125	That every word doth almost tell my name,	s
1126	For thee against myself I'll vow debate,	s
1127	For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.	s
1128	Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;	s
1129	Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	s
1130	Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,	s
1131	This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,	s
1132	Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,	s
1133	Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;	s
1134	Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,	s
1135	To linger out a purposed overthrow.	s
1136	If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	s
1137	When other petty griefs have done their spite	s
1138	But in the onset come; so shall I taste	s
1139	At first the very worst of fortune's might,	s
1140	And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	s
1141	Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	s
1142	Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,	s
1143	Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,	s
1144	Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;	s
1145	And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	s
1146	Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:	s
1147	But these particulars are not my measure;	s
1148	All these I better in one general best.	s
1149	But when she saw my woeful state,	s
1150	Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,	s
1151	Of more delight than hawks or horses be;	s
1152	And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:	s
1153	Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take	s
1154	But being both from me, both to each friend,	s
1155	But do thy worst to steal thyself away,	s
1156	For term of life thou art assured mine,	s
1157	And life no longer than thy love will stay,	s
1158	For it depends upon that love of thine.	s
1159	Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	s
1160	When in the least of them my life hath end.	s
1161	I see a better state to me belongs	s
1162	Than that which on thy humour doth depend;	s
1163	Suspect I may, but not directly tell;	s
1164	Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.	s
1165	O, what a happy title do I find,	s
1166	Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	s
1167	But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?	s
1168	Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	s
1169	Like a deceived husband; so love's face	s
1170	May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;	s
1171	Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:	s
1172	For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	s
1173	Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.	s
1174	In many's looks the false heart's history	s
1175	Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,	s
1176	Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.	s
1177	That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;	s
1178	Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,	s
1179	How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,	s
1180	if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!	s
1181	They that have power to hurt and will do none,	s
1182	That do not do the thing they most do show,	s
1183	Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,	s
1184	Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,	s
1185	They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	s
1186	And husband nature's riches from expense;	s
1187	They are the lords and owners of their faces,	s
1188	Others but stewards of their excellence.	s
1189	The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,	s
1190	Though to itself it only live and die,	s
1191	But if that flower with base infection meet,	s
1192	The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	s
1193	For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;	s
1194	Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.	s
1195	How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	s
1196	Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,	s
1197	Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!	s
1198	O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!	s
1199	That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	s
1200	Making lascivious comments on thy sport,	s
1201	Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;	s
1202	When I perceive that men as plants increase,	s
1203	O, what a mansion have those vices got	s
1204	Which for their habitation chose out thee,	s
1205	Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,	s
1206	And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove	s
1207	Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;	s
1208	The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	s
1209	Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;	s
1210	Which like two spirits do suggest me still:	s
1211	Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;	s
1212	For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,	s
1213	As on the finger of a throned queen	s
1214	The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,	s
1215	For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,	s
1216	How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,	s
1217	If like a lamb he could his looks translate!	s
1218	How many gazers mightst thou lead away,	s
1219	If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!	s
1220	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
1221	How like a winter hath my absence been	s
1222	From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!	s
1223	What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!	s
1224	What old December's bareness every where!	s
1225	And yet this time removed was summer's time,	s
1226	The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,	s
1227	Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,	s
1228	Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:	s
1229	Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	s
1230	But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;	s
1231	For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,	s
1232	And, thou away, the very birds are mute;	s
1233	Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer	s
1234	That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	s
1235	From you have I been absent in the spring,	s
1236	How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made	s
1237	Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,	s
1238	That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.	s
1239	Of different flowers in odour and in hue	s
1240	Could make me any summer's story tell,	s
1241	Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;	s
1242	Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,	s
1243	Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;	s
1244	Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	s
1245	Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,	s
1246	As with your shadow I with these did play:	s
1247	The forward violet thus did I chide:	s
1248	Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	s
1249	If not from my love's breath? The purple pride	s
1250	Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	s
1251	And haply of our old acquaintance tell.	s
1252	The lily I condemned for thy hand,	s
1253	And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:	s
1254	The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	s
1255	One blushing shame, another white despair;	s
1256	Straight in her heart did mercy come,	s
1257	And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;	s
1258	But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth	s
1259	A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	s
1260	Holds in perfection but a little moment,	s
1261	But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.	s
1262	Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long	s
1263	To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	s
1264	Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	s
1265	Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?	s
1266	Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem	s
1267	In gentle numbers time so idly spent;	s
1268	Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	s
1269	And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	s
1270	If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	s
1271	If any, be a satire to decay,	s
1272	And make Time's spoils despised every where.	s
1273	Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;	s
1274	So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.	s
1275	O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends	s
1276	For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	s
1277	Both truth and beauty on my love depends;	s
1278	So dost thou too, and therein dignified.	s
1279	They were but sweet, but figures of delight,	s
1280	'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;	s
1281	Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;	s
1282	But best is best, if never intermix'd?'	s
1283	Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	s
1284	Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee	s
1285	To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,	s
1286	And to be praised of ages yet to be.	s
1287	Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how	s
1288	To make him seem long hence as he shows now.	s
1289	My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;	s
1290	I love not less, though less the show appear:	s
1291	That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming	s
1292	The owner's tongue doth publish every where.	s
1293	When I was wont to greet it with my lays,	s
1294	As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	s
1295	Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,	s
1296	Not that the summer is less pleasant now	s
1297	Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	s
1298	Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,	s
1299	And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	s
1300	Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,	s
1301	Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand	s
1302	Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,	s
1303	That having such a scope to show her pride,	s
1304	The argument all bare is of more worth	s
1305	O, blame me not, if I no more can write!	s
1306	Look in your glass, and there appears a face	s
1307	That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	s
1308	Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.	s
1309	Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,	s
1310	To mar the subject that before was well?	s
1311	For to no other pass my verses tend	s
1312	Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;	s
1313	Was used in giving gentle doom,	s
1314	Your own glass shows you when you look in it.	s
1315	To me, fair friend, you never can be old,	s
1316	For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	s
1317	Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold	s
1318	Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	s
1319	Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	s
1320	In process of the seasons have I seen,	s
1321	Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,	s
1322	Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,	s
1323	Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;	s
1324	So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,	s
1325	Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:	s
1326	For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;	s
1327	Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.	s
1328	Let not my love be call'd idolatry,	s
1329	Nor my beloved as an idol show,	s
1330	Since all alike my songs and praises be	s
1331	To one, of one, still such, and ever so.	s
1332	Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	s
1333	Still constant in a wondrous excellence;	s
1334	Therefore my verse to constancy confined,	s
1335	One thing expressing, leaves out difference.	s
1336	'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,	s
1337	To win me soon to hell, my female evil	s
1338	And in this change is my invention spent,	s
1339	Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	s
1340	'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,	s
1341	For that which longer nurseth the disease,	s
1342	When in the chronicle of wasted time	s
1343	I see descriptions of the fairest wights,	s
1344	And beauty making beautiful old rhyme	s
1345	In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,	s
1346	Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,	s
1347	Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	s
1348	I see their antique pen would have express'd	s
1349	Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall.	s
1350	So all their praises are but prophecies	s
1351	Of this our time, all you prefiguring;	s
1352	'I hate' she alter'd with an end,	s
1353	They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	s
1354	For we, which now behold these present days,	s
1355	Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	s
1356	Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul	s
1357	Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	s
1358	The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured	s
1359	And the sad augurs mock their own presage;	s
1360	Incertainties now crown themselves assured	s
1361	And peace proclaims olives of endless age.	s
1362	But do not so; I love thee in such sort	s
1363	My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	s
1364	While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:	s
1365	And thou in this shalt find thy monument,	s
1366	When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.	s
1367	What's in the brain that ink may character	s
1368	Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?	s
1369	What's new to speak, what new to register,	s
1370	That may express my love or thy dear merit?	s
1371	Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,	s
1372	I must, each day say o'er the very same,	s
1373	The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.	s
1374	Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.	s
1375	That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?	s
1376	Weighs not the dust and injury of age,	s
1377	Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	s
1378	But makes antiquity for aye his page,	s
1379	Finding the first conceit of love there bred	s
1380	Where time and outward form would show it dead.	s
1381	O, never say that I was false of heart,	s
1382	Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.	s
1383	As easy might I from myself depart	s
1384	As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:	s
1385	That is my home of love: if I have ranged,	s
1386	Like him that travels I return again,	s
1387	Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,	s
1388	So that myself bring water for my stain.	s
1389	Never believe, though in my nature reign'd	s
1390	All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,	s
1391	O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,	s
1392	To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;	s
1393	For nothing this wide universe I call,	s
1394	Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.	s
1395	Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there	s
1396	And made myself a motley to the view,	s
1397	Made old offences of affections new;	s
1398	Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	s
1399	Askance and strangely: but, by all above,	s
1400	These blenches gave my heart another youth,	s
1401	And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	s
1402	Now all is done, have what shall have no end:	s
1403	Mine appetite I never more will grind	s
1404	Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,	s
1405	A god in love, to whom I am confined.	s
1406	Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,	s
1407	Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.	s
1408	O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	s
1409	The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	s
1410	That did not better for my life provide	s
1411	Than public means which public manners breeds.	s
1412	Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	s
1413	And almost thence my nature is subdued	s
1414	To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	s
1415	Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;	s
1416	Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink	s
1417	My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,	s
1418	No bitterness that I will bitter think,	s
1419	Nor double penance, to correct correction.	s
1420	Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye	s
1421	Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	s
1422	To swear against the truth so foul a lie!	s
1423	Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;	s
1424	For what care I who calls me well or ill,	s
1425	So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?	s
1426	You are my all the world, and I must strive	s
1427	To know my shames and praises from your tongue:	s
1428	None else to me, nor I to none alive,	s
1429	That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.	s
1430	In so profound abysm I throw all care	s
1431	Of others' voices, that my adder's sense	s
1432	To critic and to flatterer stopped are.	s
1433	Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:	s
1434	You are so strongly in my purpose bred	s
1435	That all the world besides methinks are dead.	s
1436	Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;	s
1437	And that which governs me to go about	s
1438	Doth part his function and is partly blind,	s
1439	Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.	s
1440	Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	s
1441	Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:	s
1442	Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	s
1443	From heaven to hell is flown away;	s
1444	For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,	s
1445	The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	s
1446	Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?	s
1447	With all triumphant splendor on my brow;	s
1448	Incapable of more, replete with you,	s
1449	My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.	s
1450	Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,	s
1451	Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?	s
1452	The more I hear and see just cause of hate?	s
1453	And that your love taught it this alchemy,	s
1454	To make of monsters and things indigest	s
1455	Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,	s
1456	Creating every bad a perfect best,	s
1457	No want of conscience hold it that I call	s
1458	O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,	s
1459	And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:	s
1460	Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,	s
1461	And to his palate doth prepare the cup:	s
1462	If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin	s
1463	That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	s
1464	Those lines that I before have writ do lie,	s
1465	Even those that said I could not love you dearer:	s
1466	Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	s
1467	My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.	s
1468	But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents	s
1469	Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,	s
1470	Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,	s
1471	Hath left me, and I desperate now approve	s
1472	Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,	s
1473	Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	s
1474	When I was certain o'er incertainty,	s
1475	Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	s
1476	Love is a babe; then might I not say so,	s
1477	To give full growth to that which still doth grow?	s
1478	Let me not to the marriage of true minds	s
1479	Admit impediments. Love is not love	s
1480	Which alters when it alteration finds,	s
1481	Or bends with the remover to remove:	s
1482	O no! it is an ever-fixed mark	s
1483	That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	s
1484	Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	s
1485	Within his bending sickle's compass come:	s
1486	Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,	s
1487	If this be error and upon me proved,	s
1488	I never writ, nor no man ever loved.	s
1489	Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all	s
1490	Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	s
1491	Tempteth my better angel from my side,	s
1492	Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;	s
1493	And given to time your own dear-purchased right	s
1494	That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	s
1495	Which should transport me farthest from your sight.	s
1496	Book both my wilfulness and errors down	s
1497	And on just proof surmise accumulate;	s
1498	Bring me within the level of your frown,	s
1499	But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;	s
1500	Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	s
1501	The constancy and virtue of your love.	s
1502	Like as, to make our appetites more keen,	s
1503	With eager compounds we our palate urge,	s
1504	As, to prevent our maladies unseen,	s
1505	We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,	s
1506	Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,	s
1507	To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	s
1508	And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness	s
1509	To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	s
1510	Thus policy in love, to anticipate	s
1511	The ills that were not, grew to faults assured	s
1512	And brought to medicine a healthful state	s
1513	Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:	s
1514	Now counting best to be with you alone,	s
1515	Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.	s
1516	Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,	s
1517	Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,	s
1518	Still losing when I saw myself to win!	s
1519	What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	s
1520	Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!	s
1521	How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	s
1522	In the distraction of this madding fever!	s
1523	O benefit of ill! now I find true	s
1524	That better is by evil still made better;	s
1525	My nobler part to my gross body's treason;	s
1526	Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.	s
1527	So I return rebuked to my content	s
1528	And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.	s
1529	That you were once unkind befriends me now,	s
1530	And for that sorrow which I then did feel	s
1531	Needs must I under my transgression bow,	s
1532	Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.	s
1533	For if you were by my unkindness shaken	s
1534	As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,	s
1535	And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken	s
1536	O, that our night of woe might have remember'd	s
1537	My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,	s
1538	And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd	s
1539	And each, though enemies to either's reign,	s
1540	But that your trespass now becomes a fee;	s
1541	Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	s
1542	'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,	s
1543	When not to be receives reproach of being,	s
1544	And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	s
1545	Thyself away art resent still with me;	s
1546	For why should others false adulterate eyes	s
1547	Give salutation to my sportive blood?	s
1548	Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,	s
1549	Which in their wills count bad what I think good?	s
1550	No, I am that I am, and they that level	s
1551	At my abuses reckon up their own:	s
1552	I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;	s
1553	By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;	s
1554	Unless this general evil they maintain,	s
1555	All men are bad, and in their badness reign.	s
1556	Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain	s
1557	Full character'd with lasting memory,	s
1558	Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	s
1559	Beyond all date, even to eternity;	s
1560	Or at the least, so long as brain and heart	s
1561	Have faculty by nature to subsist;	s
1562	That in the very refuse of thy deeds	s
1563	Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.	s
1564	That poor retention could not so much hold,	s
1565	Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;	s
1566	Therefore to give them from me was I bold,	s
1567	To trust those tables that receive thee more:	s
1568	To keep an adjunct to remember thee	s
1569	Were to import forgetfulness in me.	s
1570	No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:	s
1571	Thy pyramids built up with newer might	s
1572	To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;	s
1573	They are but dressings of a former sight.	s
1574	Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire	s
1575	Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write	s
1576	And rather make them born to our desire	s
1577	Than think that we before have heard them told.	s
1578	Thy registers and thee I both defy,	s
1579	Not wondering at the present nor the past,	s
1580	O, from what power hast thou this powerful might	s
1581	Made more or less by thy continual haste.	s
1582	This I do vow and this shall ever be;	s
1583	I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.	s
1584	If my dear love were but the child of state,	s
1585	It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'	s
1586	As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,	s
1587	Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.	s
1588	No, it was builded far from accident;	s
1589	It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	s
1590	Under the blow of thralled discontent,	s
1591	Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:	s
1592	It fears not policy, that heretic,	s
1593	Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,	s
1594	But all alone stands hugely politic,	s
1595	That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.	s
1596	To this I witness call the fools of time,	s
1597	Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	s
1598	Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,	s
1599	With my extern the outward honouring,	s
1600	But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	s
1601	Which prove more short than waste or ruining?	s
1602	Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	s
1603	Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,	s
1604	For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,	s
1605	Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?	s
1606	No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,	s
1607	And take thou my oblation, poor but free,	s
1608	Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,	s
1609	But mutual render, only me for thee.	s
1610	Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul	s
1611	When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.	s
1612	Now with the drops of this most balmy time	s
1613	Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;	s
1614	Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st	s
1615	Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;	s
1616	If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,	s
1617	As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,	s
1618	She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill	s
1619	May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.	s
1620	Love is too young to know what conscience is;	s
1621	She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:	s
1622	Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,	s
1623	And her quietus is to render thee.	s
1624	In the old age black was not counted fair,	s
1625	Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;	s
1626	But now is black beauty's successive heir,	s
1627	And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:	s
1628	For since each hand hath put on nature's power,	s
1629	Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,	s
1630	Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,	s
1631	But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.	s
1632	Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,	s
1633	Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem	s
1634	At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,	s
1635	Slandering creation with a false esteem:	s
1636	Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,	s
1637	How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,	s
1638	Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	s
1639	What merit do I in myself respect,	s
1640	The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	s
1641	Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	s
1642	To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,	s
1643	And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	s
1644	But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,	s
1645	To be so tickled, they would change their state	s
1646	And situation with those dancing chips,	s
1647	O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,	s
1648	Making dead wood more blest than living lips.	s
1649	Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,	s
1650	Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	s
1651	At random from the truth vainly express'd;	s
1652	Is lust in action; and till action, lust	s
1653	Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,	s
1654	Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,	s
1655	Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,	s
1656	Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	s
1657	Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait	s
1658	On purpose laid to make the taker mad;	s
1659	Mad in pursuit and in possession so;	s
1660	Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;	s
1661	A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;	s
1662	Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.	s
1663	All this the world well knows; yet none knows well	s
1664	To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.	s
1665	The uncertain sickly appetite to please.	s
1666	Coral is far more red than her lips' red;	s
1667	If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;	s
1668	For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,	s
1669	I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,	s
1670	But no such roses see I in her cheeks;	s
1671	And in some perfumes is there more delight	s
1672	Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	s
1673	I love to hear her speak, yet well I know	s
1674	I grant I never saw a goddess go;	s
1675	My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:	s
1676	And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare	s
1677	As any she belied with false compare.	s
1678	In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	s
1679	As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	s
1680	For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	s
1681	Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	s
1682	The little Love-god lying once asleep	s
1683	Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:	s
1684	To say they err I dare not be so bold,	s
1685	Although I swear it to myself alone.	s
1686	And, to be sure that is not false I swear,	s
1687	A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,	s
1688	One on another's neck, do witness bear	s
1689	Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.	s
1690	In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	s
1691	And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.	s
1692	Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,	s
1693	Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,	s
1694	Have put on black and loving mourners be,	s
1695	Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.	s
1696	And truly not the morning sun of heaven	s
1697	Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,	s
1698	Nor that full star that ushers in the even	s
1699	Doth half that glory to the sober west,	s
1700	As those two mourning eyes become thy face:	s
1701	O, let it then as well beseem thy heart	s
1702	Growing a bath and healthful remedy	s
1703	And suit thy pity like in every part.	s
1704	Then will I swear beauty herself is black	s
1705	And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	s
1706	Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	s
1707	For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!	s
1708	If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.	s
1709	But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?	s
1710	And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:	s
1711	Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;	s
1712	A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.	s
1713	For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,	s
1714	But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;	s
1715	Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;	s
1716	Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:	s
1717	And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,	s
1718	What means the world to say it is not so?	s
1719	So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,	s
1720	And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,	s
1721	Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine	s
1722	Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:	s
1723	But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	s
1724	For thou art covetous and he is kind;	s
1725	He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	s
1726	Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.	s
1727	The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,	s
1728	Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,	s
1729	Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.	s
1730	So him I lose through my unkind abuse.	s
1731	Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:	s
1732	He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	s
1733	Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'	s
1734	To thee I send this written embassage,	s
1735	More than enough am I that vex thee still,	s
1736	To thy sweet will making addition thus.	s
1737	Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,	s
1738	Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	s
1739	Shall will in others seem right gracious,	s
1740	And in my will no fair acceptance shine?	s
1741	The sea all water, yet receives rain still	s
1742	And in abundance addeth to his store;	s
1743	So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'	s
1744	One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.	s
1745	Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;	s
1746	Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	s
1747	If thy soul check thee that I come so near,	s
1748	Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'	s
1749	So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,	s
1750	Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.	s
1751	'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	s
1752	Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.	s
1753	In things of great receipt with ease we prove	s
1754	Among a number one is reckon'd none:	s
1755	That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:	s
1756	Though in thy stores' account I one must be;	s
1757	For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold	s
1758	That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:	s
1759	And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'	s
1760	Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	s
1761	That they behold, and see not what they see?	s
1762	They know what beauty is, see where it lies,	s
1763	Yet what the best is take the worst to be.	s
1764	If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	s
1765	Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,	s
1766	Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	s
1767	From hence your memory death cannot take,	s
1768	Why should my heart think that a several plot	s
1769	Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?	s
1770	Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,	s
1771	To put fair truth upon so foul a face?	s
1772	In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	s
1773	And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.	s
1774	Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.	s
1775	I do believe her, though I know she lies,	s
1776	That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	s
1777	Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	s
1778	Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	s
1779	Although she knows my days are past the best,	s
1780	Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:	s
1781	On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.	s
1782	Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	s
1783	O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,	s
1784	And age in love loves not to have years told:	s
1785	Therefore I lie with her and she with me,	s
1786	And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.	s
1787	O, call not me to justify the wrong	s
1788	That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;	s
1789	Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;	s
1790	Use power with power and slay me not by art.	s
1791	Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,	s
1792	Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:	s
1793	What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	s
1794	Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?	s
1795	Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows	s
1796	Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	s
1797	And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	s
1798	Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,	s
1799	Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.	s
1800	Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press	s
1801	My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;	s
1802	Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	s
1803	The manner of my pity-wanting pain.	s
1804	If I might teach thee wit, better it were,	s
1805	Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;	s
1806	As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,	s
1807	No news but health from their physicians know;	s
1808	For if I should despair, I should grow mad,	s
1809	And in my madness might speak ill of thee:	s
1810	Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	s
1811	Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,	s
1812	That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	s
1813	Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	s
1814	In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,	s
1815	For they in thee a thousand errors note;	s
1816	But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,	s
1817	Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;	s
1818	Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,	s
1819	Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,	s
1820	Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited	s
1821	To any sensual feast with thee alone:	s
1822	But my five wits nor my five senses can	s
1823	Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,	s
1824	Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,	s
1825	Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:	s
1826	Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	s
1827	That she that makes me sin awards me pain.	s
1828	Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,	s
1829	Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:	s
1830	O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,	s
1831	And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;	s
1832	Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,	s
1833	That have profaned their scarlet ornaments	s
1834	And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;	s
1835	Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.	s
1836	Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those	s
1837	Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:	s
1838	Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows	s
1839	Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.	s
1840	If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	s
1841	By self-example mayst thou be denied!	s
1842	Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch	s
1843	One of her feather'd creatures broke away,	s
1844	Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?	s
1845	In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,	s
1846	Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,	s
1847	Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	s
1848	To follow that which flies before her face,	s
1849	Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	s
1850	So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,	s
1851	If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	s
1852	But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,	s
1853	And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:	s
1854	So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'	s
